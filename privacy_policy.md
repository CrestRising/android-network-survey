## Privacy Policy

Christian Rowlands built the Network Survey app as an Open Source app. This App is provided by Christian Rowlands at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the App.

If you installed this app from the Google Play store then Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics information is stored in Google Firebase. This data is anonoymous
but data related to app crashes and general app usage is set to Google Firebase to improve the stability and functionality of this app.

No other information is stored. All survey log files remain on the phone unless you, the user, moves the. All connections including MQTT and gRPC server connections
are to servers have to be configured and initiated by the user, and a default server is not provided.

**Log Data**

The App does have the capability to log information to a GeoPackage file, but that file remains on your device and it is up to you if you want to copy the file off the device to another device of your choosing.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
